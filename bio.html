            <p>Ifeoluwa Oluwaseun Olowu is a visual artist based in Lagos, Nigeria whose new creative 
                development of bringing his art to life through Augmented Reality (AR) is progressively 
                becoming a global desire. Ifeoluwa was born in Lagos, Nigeria and he attended Yaba College 
                of Technology primary and secondary school where he received his early education. 
                His enthusiasm for art increased as he watched cartoons, movies, and read comic books
                as a child, and at the tender age of 10, he started drawing inspiration from comic books 
                and the natural world. This enthusiasm was nurtured throughout his childhood and deepened 
                when he decided to pursue his Bachelorâ€™s degree in Visual Arts at the esteemed University
                of Lagos, where he majored in painting. Ife's artistic technique evolved into an expressionist
                one that mixes drawing, designs, and paints to produce aesthetically appealing works as he later
                delved deeper into painting and developed his printing and design talents. He started researching 
                Augmented Reality and the potential for engaging with conventional art in live form as a result
                of his passion of colors, new concepts, and shape. The brilliance of Ifeoluwa's work has 
                attracted attention on a global scale. His art has been featured prominently by renowned 
                news outlets such as CNN, BBC, Reuters, Voice of Africa, TV5 Monde, Channels, Vanguard newspaper,
                Punch newspaper, Yahoo and more. Through his visionary approach, Ifeoluwa Oluwaseun Olowu is 
                redefining the possibilities of art, captivating audiences around the world with his breathtaking
                creations.<br/> <a href="http://linktr.ee/Ifeolowu">Link Tree</a></p>

                    Ifeoluwa Oluwaseun Olowu In my artistic journey, self-expression takes center stage. 
                    Through the vibrant and vivid palette of colors, I immerse my audience in a world of 
                    emotions, moods, and feelings. My experimentation with various art forms allows me to 
                    push the boundaries of creativity, yet I find myself most at home working with paints.
                    Each brushstroke becomes a reflection of my inner voice, creating pieces that resonate 
                    with the essence of human experiences. The interplay of colors and textures breathes 
                    life into my canvases, inviting viewers to journey beyond the surface and connect with 
                    the depth of the art. My artistic process is a dance of intuition and intention, allowing
                    ach piece to unfold organically while still being guided by a purposeful vision. I seek
                    to leave a lasting impression on those who encounter my work, evoking a sense of wonder
                    and a glimpse into the complexity of human existence. As I continue to explore the 
                    vast realm of artistic expression, I am drawn to the profound impact art has on the
                    human soul. My aspiration is for my art to become a vessel through which viewers 
                    can find solace, inspiration, and a shared understanding of the human condition.
